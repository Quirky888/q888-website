Q888 Website Rules (Canonical)

Tone:
- Quiet confidence, system-aware, human.
- No marketing CTA language.
- Humor only in Infocigan microcopy, never in recruiter-facing Contact.

Visual:
- Landing background: near-white fog with subtle grain.
- Typography: primary sans + monospace for system metadata.
- Spacing: generous margins, whitespace is active.

Motion:
- Implied, restrained. No loops that beg attention.
- Allowed: opacity settling, rare metadata flicker, slow micro drift.
- Forbidden: playful easing, bouncy transitions, loud parallax.

Navigation:
- Directional reveal (left/right) is a meaning ritual, not a normal page jump.
- Toolbar is an instrument panel: Q888 / Projects / Infocigan / Contact.
- Exits must feel like retreat, not teleport.

Infocigan:
- Not a store UI. No cart, no checkout, no filters, no urgency.
- Floating artifacts, portal hub, contact-first.

Quality:
- Prefer simple, readable code. Avoid over-engineering.
- Optimize images, lazy-load large assets.
